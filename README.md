# System-Lock
*DISCLAIMER: DO NOT use this with malicious intent. This is meant for educational purposes.*

This is a program that is used for locking down a computer system. It prompts the user for a password. If the password is correct, it passes through. If not, there are 3 attempts to get it right. After the third failed attempt, the system shuts down immediately. 

This is still under experimentation, as I'm still working on an anti-close component, as well as a component that doesn't allow any other programs to be opened

This program can also be set up to run on startup to keep locking the system in case the user tries to get rid of it by restarting the system.
